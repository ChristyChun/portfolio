    <h1> Christy Chun </h1>
    <p> Hey, I'm from Queens and I attend Robert F. Wagner Jr. SSAT in Long Island City. I'm 16 turning 17 years old this year an my horoscope is leo. I am the middle child in between my older brother and younger sister. I spend most of my time binge watching shows and chocolate. </p>

    <p> So far, I've learned + noticed that both Sratch and Python are platforms to command different things. While scratch is for dictating what different characters + sprites do, python is more for using user input and calcuating things. This includes mathematic problems, what two words equal, and if certain statements are true or false. 
                              <br> While debugging my program today, I realized there was a lot of logical and mathematical thinking in coding-- especially when it comes to making shapes. I felt tired of solving math problems after a while and the most difficult challenge I faced was finding the right angles to turn at to create the right lines.
